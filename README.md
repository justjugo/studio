# TCF Prep App

This is a Next.js application designed to help users prepare for the Test de Connaissance du Fran√ßais (TCF). It includes training modules, practice tests, and progress tracking, all powered by Firebase.

This project was bootstrapped with Firebase Studio.

## Running the Project Locally

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps. You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later) installed on your system.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of the project, and run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application in development mode. You can view it by opening [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser.

The app will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

## Publishing Your Project to GitHub

To store your project on GitHub and track its history, follow these steps.

### 1. Initialize a Git Repository

If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your project's root folder.

```bash
git init -b main
```

### 2. Add and Commit Your Files

Add all your project files to the repository's tracking index and create an initial commit.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of my TCF Prep App"
```

### 3. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.  Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
3.  Give your repository a name (e.g., `tcf-prep-app`).
4.  Choose whether you want the repository to be public or private.
5.  **Important**: Do **not** initialize the new repository with a `README` or other files. It needs to be empty.
6.  Click **"Create repository"**.

### 4. Link Your Local Project to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, the page will display a URL. Copy it. Then, run the following command in your terminal, replacing the URL with your repository's URL.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
```

### 5. Push Your Code to GitHub

Finally, push your committed code from your local `main` branch to the `origin` remote on GitHub.

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Your project is now live on GitHub! You can continue to commit changes and push them as you develop your application.
